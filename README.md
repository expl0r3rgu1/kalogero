# kalogero

Kalogero will help you discover the next cryptocurrencies to sky rocket in the near future.
No more regrets from not buying earlier. Kalogero got you covered.

## Description

This is the server version of Kalogero. It will keep running and web scraping Twitter and Reddit to discover the next cryptocurrencies to get popular in the near future.
We are looking forward to implement a set of requests you can make to the server to as for example retrieve the list of the coins which are going to increase in value in the next days or so.
